This is the repo for the CAS AML Uni Bern module 6 project based on reinforcement learning. 
The first part is a maze generator and solver using DQN or Random. Idea is to also add other methods to test
Part two will be a rpg fighting part.

Part 1 is escape to muerren(?)

Part 2 is escape from MÃ¼rren. Run around the maze and drink beer, ice holes (Frozen lake+)
